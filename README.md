# Compilation of my work
All of these are my hobby projects regarding various things I've done.

## Artificial Intelligence
### Reinforcement Learning
- [RL From scratch](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/RL_from_scratch) - This is where I write RL related stuff from scratch in python like QLearning, SARSA, TD-lambda etc.
- [DQN-Atari](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/DQN-Atari) - DQN based agent for Atari games because what's the point of doing RL if you don't try to play atari with it.
- [Food waste prevention using RL](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/FoodWastePrevention-RL) - Multi-Agent RL for dynamic pricing of food to save wastage while maximizing profit.
- [RLCaR](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/RLCaR) - Reinforcement Learning based Cache Replacement
- NOTE TO SELF: Compile a repo of all custom gym environments, make a repo and link it here.

### Vision
- [Image Segmentation Test Bench](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/Image_Segmentation) - A collection of various models, archtectures and augmentations for Image Segmentation
- [Modular GANs](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/Modular-GANs) - A modular Test bench for my GAN related experiments. 
- [Deep Learning Otae Detector](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/deep_learning_otae_detector) - An end-to-end system to detect anime character in images using Deep learning. With an easy to use, self made web API and frontend.

### Misc
- [FairGAN](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/FairGAN) - GANs based approach to mitigate gender bias in word embeddings.
- [Gradient Descent Optimization](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/GradientDescent_Optimization) - GD optimization techniques like Adam and SGD from scratch.
- [Statistics for Machine Learning](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/stats-for-ml) - This repository is my record of simple experimentations on things related to stats, probability and similar interesting stuff that is needed for machine learning (and participating on kaggle).
- [PROLOG Sample code](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/IAmNotGay) - Very basis PROLOG code to prove sexuality of a person using simple logic based rules.
- [Santander](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/Santander) - WARNING! - >> Scattered code << for my silver medal solution in  https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/

## Utility Software
- [yTermPlayer](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/yTermPlayer) - Stream youtube playlists as audio on linux terminal. More than 10k downloads from pypi.
- [DTUResults](https://dturesult.com/) - An online portal to compute result analytics with visual data for students of Delhi Technological University.
- [Dataset scraper](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/DatasetScraper) - Tool to create image datasets for machine learning problems by scraping search engines like Google, Bing and Baidu. 

## Web Development
- [Personal website](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/Web-Console) - A simple console-based personal website (not updated).
- [Web-Console](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/Web-Console) - A simple Information Console for personal websites. Can be used for personal portfolio/resume websites. Live example: [https://timetraveller-san.github.io/](https://timetraveller-san.github.io/)
- [Whatsapp.moe](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/whatsapp.moe) - whatsapp.moe is a google chrome extensions and a mozilla firefox add-on to make whatsapp cute
- [ML frontend template](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/ML-frontend-template) - A simple ML frontend template to receive ML features from an HTML form and pass it onto the flask API to fetch the result

# Academic
- [Bezier curve](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/bezier-curve) - Bezier curve animated implementation on python
- [Turing machine simulator](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/Turing-machine-simulator) - Python implementation of a Turing machine simulator with visualization
- [Data Encryption Standard](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/Data-Encryption-Standard) - Python implementation of Data Encryption Standard (DES) - Computer Networks
